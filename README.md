### Hi there, I am an oceanographer 🌊 passionate about environmental 🌎 data analysis 💻📊, mostly marine biogeochemistry and physics.
### I'm currently learning 📚 github, and I hope that soon I'll be able to share all the work I carry out on R, Python and Matlab and numerical modeling.
### Please, feel free to ask me about oceanography, my career or anything you want. 😁
